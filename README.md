## Operating Systems Project: Directory Space Checker

This project was developed as part of the Operating Systems course at the University of Aveiro (UA). It includes two Bash scripts: `spacecheck.sh` and `spacerate.sh`.

## spacecheck.sh

`spacecheck.sh` is a Bash script that accepts multiple directory paths as input. It traverses the specified directories and their subdirectories to gather information about the size each directory occupies on the disk. Users can define the sorting order of the directory sizes by passing specific arguments.

### Usage

To use `spacecheck.sh`, you can run it with the following command:
```bash
./spacecheck.sh [options] directory1 directory2 ...
```

**Options:**
- `-s`: Specify a minimum file size.
- `-d`: Specify a file's last modification date.
- `-n`: Specify a regular expression for file names.
- `-l`: Specify a maximum number of lines to show.
- `-r`: Sort by reverse order
- `-a`: Sort by file name.
## spacerate.sh

`spacerate.sh` is another Bash script that allows you to compare the output of two files generated by `spacecheck.sh`. It calculates the change in space that occurred on the disk for each directory and reports if a specific file was removed or is new.

### Usage

To use `spacerate.sh`, you can run it with the following command:

```bash
./spacerate.sh [options] file1 file2
```
**Options:**
- `-l`: Specify a maximum number of lines to show.
- `-r`: Sort by reverse order
- `-a`: Sort by file name.
